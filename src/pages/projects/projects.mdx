# 3 Projects for learning

## 1: Live Cricket Score App

### Motivation

I'm a big cricket fan and always want to keep up with matches wherever I am. Currently, I use ![ESPNCricinfo](https://www.espncricinfo.com/) which is great on desktop however the mobile version is a bit too slow for my liking. Hence, I want to build my own version that means I'm up to date with the ball by ball coverage üèè.

### Tech Stack

Since this is a relatively simple application my goal is to get something working quickly and deploy as fast as possible.

#### Backend

- Python

#### Frontend

- React/Typescript
- Tailwindcss
- Vite

#### Infrastructure

- AWS API Gateway
- AWS Lambda
- AWS Cloudfront

## 2: Language Learning App

### Motivation

I've wanted to improve my Urdu for a while but can never find the time to study it properly. Furthermore many of the popular language learning apps don't have an Urdu syllabus. After being inspired by this ![talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WYBOuP1Y6E&ab_channel=AWSEvents) I decided to have a go at building my own Urdu language app.

### Tech Stack

I'll start with a simple feature of reminding me to memorise particular words but I'd like the ability to add more features to the app as I go along so the tech stack will be a bit more complex.

#### Backend

- Python
- GraphQL

#### Frontend

- React/Typescript
- React Query
- Tailwindcss
- Vite

#### Infrastructure

- AWS API Gateway
- AWS Appsync
- AWS DynamoDB
- AWS Lambda
- AWS Cloudfront
- AWS Machine Learning
