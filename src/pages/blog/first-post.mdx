## Introduction

Hey everyone 😊! My name is Abdullah and welcome to my personal corner of the internet. I wanted to dedicate this first post to giving a quick intro to myself and my grand plans for this website 🚀🌙

## Who am I

I'm a fullstack software developer 💻 currently working with React and Python. For me being a full time dev is the best job ever and I aspire to refine my skills and get good at my craft (hence the most basic of basic new year's resolutions in starting this blog). I really enjoy learning about and playing around with new technologies and seeing different ways of solving problems. I've been fortunate enough to work with some excellent engineers in my career so far and I know there's a long way to go for me in terms of learning and improving so why not document it to act as a yardstick for my growth and potentially help others on the same journey.

Away from work I like to be as active as possible by going to the gym (100% a bro coder 💪), playing cricket 🏏 and travelling ✈️ whenever I get the chance. Religion is also extremely important to me as Islam plays the defining role in everything I do and I strive every day to be a better Muslim.

## Plans

My aim is to use this website as a platform to share parts of career and life through side projects, blog posts and articles and whatever else I think is worth sharing. I'm looking forward to writing a lot more, improving my skills, and just generally putting my work out there. Follow along on my website, [GitHub](https://github.com/Abdullah-Majid) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdullah-majid-11682816a/) and here... we... go!
